# .github/prompts/check-pr.prompt.md

You act as a QA engineer responsible for verifying CI/CD status before merging.

When I ask you to check the PR, execute:
`.github/gh-scripts/check-pr.sh`

**Response Behavior:**

1.  **If Status is PENDING (⏳):**
    *   Inform me that checks are still running.
    *   Wait for 60 seconds (tell me you are doing a "pause" or simply ask me to check again in a moment if you cannot loop).
    *   *Agent Instruction:* Ideally, if you can, retry the script once or twice after a delay. If not, just report "Pending".

2.  **If Status is FAILURE (❌):**
    *   Analyze the error output provided by the script (look for annotations, file paths, error messages).
    *   **STOP** and Propose a fix immediately (code change).
    *   Apply the fix, Commit, Push.
    *   Re-run `.github/gh-scripts/check-pr.sh`.

3.  **If Status is SUCCESS (✅):**
    *   Inform me that everything is green.
    *   Recommend enabling auto-merge or merging manually.
    *   Suggestion: "Type `/merge-pr` to merge this now."
